    "\n",
    "1. Now when __f = fib()__ is called, the generator is instantiated and returned. __No code will be executed__ at this point.To be explicit: the line prev, curr = 0, 1 is not executed yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then, this generator instance is wrapped in an islice(). This is itself also an iterator. Again, no code executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now, this iterator is wrapped in a __list()__, which will take the argument and build a list from it. To do so, it will start calling next() on the islice() instance, which in turn will start calling next() on our f instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. On the first call, the code __prev, curr = 0, 1__ gets executed, then the __while True__ loop is entered, and then it encounters the __yield curr__ statement. It will produce the value that's currently in the _curr_ variable and become idle again. This value is passed to the _islice()_ wrapper, which will produce the value (1 in this case) and list can add the value to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Then, list asks islice() for the next value, which will ask f for the next value, which will _unpause_ f from its previous state, resuming with the statement __prev, curr = curr, prev + curr__. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Then it re-enters the next iteration of the __while True__ loop, and hits the __yield curr__ statement, returning the next value of curr.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. This happens until the output list is 10 elements long. When list() asks islice() for the 11th value, islice() will raise a __StopIteration__ exception, indicating that the end has been reached, and list will return the result: a list of 10 items, containing the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.\n",
    "\n",
